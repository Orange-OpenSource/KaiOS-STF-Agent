# KaiOS agent for OpenSTF

This program is functionaly equivalent to [STFService.apk](https://github.com/openstf/STFService.apk). While STFService targets Android devices, this one monitors and performs various actions on a KaiOS device.

This is basically a server written in C++ implementing the same protocol as OpenSTF (based on protobuf).
